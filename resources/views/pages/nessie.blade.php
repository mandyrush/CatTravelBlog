                    I am Nessie. If you do anything Nessie doesn’t like, I bite you! Chasing
                    meat sticks is the best!! I love playing with toys… and clawing the couch
                    and did I mention meat sticks! My tummy demands food when I am bored. If
                    you don’t feed me in time, I bite you!
                    <br><br>

                    I don’t like car rides so if I you get a suitcase, Nessie HIDE!!! I eat
                    anything I see but sometimes my tummy will make me arf it back up, like when
                    I try to eat weather striping, don’t know why… Nessie’s were made for outside,
                    outside is the best! I like to eat grass and dream about catching birdies with
                    my teeth.

                    <br><br>
                    I like to cuddle and get lots of pets, sometimes the pets are soooo good that it
                    makes me drool. If you don’t pet me in time though… I bite you!
