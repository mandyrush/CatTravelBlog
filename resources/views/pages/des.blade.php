                    Hello there, Iâ€™m Des. I am a remote web developer who loves adventure and great
                    food. My dream is to live on a sailboat and travel the world one day in search
                    of the best coffee and sushi I can find. In the meantime, I enjoy traveling on
                    land with my wife and furry critters, visiting new places and meeting new people.
                    <br><br>

                    I like a good beer with friends and have actually created a few of my own brews
                    in my spare time. My hobbies include art, photography, and design. I also like
                    to do a little hiking and rock climbing. I spend most of my days working,
                    traveling, walking cats, petting cats and playing with cats...
