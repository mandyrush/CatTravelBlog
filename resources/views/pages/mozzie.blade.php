					Greetings, I am Mozzie (aka the Tiny Tiger). I enjoy only the finest foods,
					daily massages and stealing my humans chairs when they aren't looking. I
					provide a complementary alarm service at random times during the day and night
					for their protection which I know they thoroughly enjoy.
					<br><br>

					Bowls of water simply cannot be trusted so when I need to quench my thirst I
					summon my humans to turn on one of my water fountains, yes I have two… They
					call them sinks as if they were made for humans but we both know they are far
					too tall to drink from them properly.
					<br><br>

					My green sheep is my most prized possession, I love to listen to the melodious
					sound of its bell jingling as I bite down on it’s soft furry insides with the
					fury of 1000 tigers. In my spare time I enjoy car rides, visits to grandma’s
					house or hunting my acquaintance Nessie.
