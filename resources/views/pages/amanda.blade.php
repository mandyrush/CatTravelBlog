                    Hello! I’m Amanda. I’m a web developer, crazy cat lady in training and adventurer
                    with a weakness for sweets. There’s nothing quite like a good maple doughnut
                    or some chocolate eclairs...
                    <br><br>

                    Usually travel and pets don’t go together but as we found, where there’s a will
                    there’s a way. I love venturing to far off places I’ve never seen and learning
                    about the history and cultures. I’m always in search of great food to try or wines
                    to taste. The rest of my time is spent creating websites and catering to my furry
                    felines.
